introText = """In the realm of Luminos, a land shrouded in the mists of ancient magic and surrounded by untamed wilderness,
three distinct races coexisted for centuries â€“ Humans, Elves, and Dwarves.
They have shared the blessings of their fertile lands, harnessed the power of arcane forces, and built great cities that touched the skies.

Yet, the idyllic harmony of Luminos has been disrupted. A looming darkness, born from the depths of forgotten realms,
threatens to engulf the world in an eternal night. This malevolent force, known as the Shadow Veil,
seeks to extinguish all life, leaving only a desolate wasteland in its wake.
