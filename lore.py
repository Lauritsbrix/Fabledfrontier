three distinct races coexisted for centuries – Humans, Elves, and Dwarves.
They have shared the blessings of their fertile lands, harnessed the power of arcane forces, and built great cities that touched the skies.

Yet, the idyllic harmony of Luminos has been disrupted. A looming darkness, born from the depths of forgotten realms,

seeks to extinguish all life, leaving only a desolate wasteland in its wake.
